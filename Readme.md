This example is obsolete. We suggest that you use the [SchedulerDataStorage](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.SchedulerDataStorage) component and its built-in approach to bind labels. See the following topics for more information:

- [Appointment Labels and Statuses](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/1754/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/appointments/appointment-labels-and-statuses)
