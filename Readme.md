# (Obsolete) How to provide the capability to bind appointment labels to a datasource

<p><b>This example is obsolete.</b> In the latest versions, we suggest using a <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/1750/Controls-and-Libraries/Scheduler/Scheduler-Elements-and-Structure/SchedulerDataStorage-Component">SchedulerDataStorage</a> component and its built-in approach to bind labels. See the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/1754/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/appointments/appointment-labels-and-statuses">Appointment Labels and Statuses</a> and <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/120538/Controls-and-Libraries/Scheduler/Data-Binding/Mappings/Label-Mappings">Label Mappings</a> for details. </p>
