' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' How to provide the capability to bind appointment labels to a datasource
' 
' Due to numerous requests from our customers regarding the capability to bind
' appointment labels/statuses to a datasource, we have created this sample. Note
' that in the past, we tried to address this issue in the context of the following
' examples:
' http://www.devexpress.com/scid=E2028
' http://www.devexpress.com/scid=E2087
' They
' illustrate how to load labels form an external datasource. However, one
' limitation is still there. It is related to the default meaning of the
' Appointment.LabelId Property
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/DevExpressXtraSchedulerAppointment_LabelIdtopic).
' The value of this property represents an index of a label in the
' AppointmentStorage.Labels
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraSchedulerAppointmentStorage_Labelstopic)
' (this label is used for this appointment).This mean that once you remove a
' particular label for this collection, indexes will be shifted. Take a moment to
' look at the http://www.devexpress.com/scid=Q413689 ticket, which describes this
' issue in detail.
' Apparently, a more advanced labels/status identification
' mechanism is required. This example illustrates how to implement this mechanism
' for labels (you can use the same approach for statuses) by extending the
' SchedulerControl Class
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraSchedulerSchedulerControltopic).
' The main idea of the approach illustrated here is to define a separate
' datasource for appointment labels (the LabelsDataSource property) and mapped
' field names for Id, Color and DisplayName (the LabelIdMappedName,
' LabelColorMappedName and LabelDisplayNameMappedName properties). If the
' datasource is not specified, we are using default label items (see the
' PopulateDefaultLabels() method). Otherwise, labels from a datasource are used.
' Note that the Appointment.LabelId property has another meaning in this scenario.
' The value of this property is used to look up a corresponding label item in the
' SchedulerControl.AppointmentViewInfoCustomizing Event
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraSchedulerSchedulerControl_AppointmentViewInfoCustomizingtopic)
' in order to assign a color defined in this label to the appointment. In
' addition, we handle the SchedulerControl.PopupMenuShowing Event
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraSchedulerSchedulerControl_PopupMenuShowingtopic)
' to populate the LabelSubMenu with custom menu items created on the fly based on
' the rows in the datasource with labels.
' To correctly display custom
' appointments' labels in the EditAppointmentForm, we override the UpdateFormCore
' and edtLabel_EditValueChanged methods in a corresponding EditAppointmentForm
' descendant. The important thing is that a SchedulerStorage instance should
' contain custom appointments' labels in its internal collection. We use the
' SchedulerControl.PopulateLabelsStorage method to replace the collection of
' pre-defined labels with a custom one.
' 
' Note that we are using a custom-made
' DataBindingController class to operate with a label datasource in a generic
' manner. This means that our approach should work correctly regardless of the
' actual datasource type, be it a DataTable or a List<T>.
' Here is a screenshot
' that illustrates meaning of the Appointment.LabelId property (pay attention to
' the CarScheduling.Label and Labels.Id field values):
' 
' Finally, we have
' implemented design-time support for the aforementioned properties:
